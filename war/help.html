<div class='question'>What is a Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    A Profile is used to help manage, organize, store and search your photos. This is the first step in creating a
    person’s photo-biography. You should create Profiles for family and friends that are part of your everyday life, the
    people that you take photos of on a regular basis. (i.e. you are helping them to create a photo documentary of their
    lives) For other people that you take photos of throughout the year that are not as involved in your everyday life
    myStoredLife created an Events category for storing these photos called Other Family and Friends. As an example, you
    would create Profiles for your children, spouse, parents, brothers and sisters, good friends and their children; if
    you are actively involved in their lives (you attend their birthday parties, school or sporting events, spend
    holidays or vacations together, etc…). For everyone else, you would store their photos under the person’s Profile
    they most relate to and then under the Event "Other Family and Friends" with a sub-event created in their name.
</div>

<div class='question'>Are there any limitations on how many Profiles I can create?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    You can create as many Profiles as you want. The key to using myStoredLife most effectively is to only create
    Profiles for people where you are active in each other’s lives. Everyone else will be stored and managed through the
    Event "Other Family and Friends".
</div>
<div class='question'>How do I add a new Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    Just click on "Add New Profile" which opens a "Create Profile" dialog box. Fill in all details and enter create.
    Refresh "My Profiles" section and you’ll see the newly created Profile.
</div>
<div class='question'>What happens when I create a new Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    As soon as you create a new Profile the person’s name will appear on the "My Profile section" without Profile
    picture. Also their name will show up in the "STORE", "SEARCH" and "PHOTO SHARING" areas to allow you to store,
    search and share the images that are related to them.
</div>
<div class='question'>How do I add a new Profile picture? For ex: My son?</div>
<div class='answer'>You need to store at least one image of your son before populating Profile picture. Follow the steps
    below:
    <ol>
        <li>Go to Upload and upload an image of your son. Uploaded images will show up in Work area.</li>
        <li>Go to Work Area and add "Photo Info" such as Caption, Who and Date", save it.</li>
        <li>Click on "Store Photos" and store the image by selecting your Son’s Profile.</li>
        <li>Go back to "My Profiles" and click on "Change Photo" underneath your son’s Profile, which opens a "Search
            Profile Photo" window
        </li>
        <li>Search for your son’s image by entering one of the attributes from the previously added image or simple
            click search. Select the image you want to use for your Son’s Profile photo and follow the next steps on the
            screen
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class='question'>How can I edit/change a Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to "My Profiles" and locate your son’s Profile</li>
        <li>Click on "Edit", make necessary changes and save it back.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class='question'>How can I delete my son’s Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to "My Profiles and locate your son’s Profile</li>
        <li>Click on "Delete" and follow steps</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class='question'>What happens to all the images if I delete my son’s Profile?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    You lose all the images as soon as you delete any Profile. Take extra precautions while performing this action. If
    you want to keep the images before deleting any Profile:
    <ol>
        <li>Go To "Search"</li>
        <li>Search for all images of your son by selecting "your son’s Profile"</li>
        <li>Display results show all the images of your son.</li>
        <li>Select all the images that you want to keep by clicking on the "To Work Area" icon. This will push the
            images to "Work Area"
        </li>
        <li>Later you can delete the Profile, but photos are stored in the "Work Area" for future usage.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2 id="upload-index">Upload</h2>

<div class='question'>How do I upload my Images?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    Click on the “Upload” button and follow the given instructions.<br/>
    There are 2 upload options available:
    <ol>
        <li>Simple Upload: Allows you to upload a single image at a time and the size of the image must be less than 1
            MB.
        </li>
        <li>Batch Upload: Allows you to upload more than one image, Use the browser window to locate your pictures
            in your computer’s directory using the Java console, drag and drop or double click the images to place them
            in the upload window and click on the Start Upload icon <img src="/images/help/upload4.png"/>
        </li>
    </ol>

</div>

<div class='question'>Is there any limitation on the Image size that I upload?</div>
<div class='answer'>No, there is not a limitation on the image size. myStoredLife reduces the image size to 200-300kB
    (1600 X 1200 pixels) to increase upload speed and optimize your viewing experience.
</div>

<div class='question'>Is there a way to delete an image that I drag and drop in the console window before start
    uploading?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
    Yes, that’s very simple. Every image added to the upload window using Java Console will have few icons displayed
    with that image. To delete an image before uploading click on the <img src='/images/help/upload3.png'/> mark for
    that image and it will be removed from the upload window. See image below. <br/>
    <img src='/images/help/upload5.png'/>

</div>

<div class='question'>Can I edit an image before start uploading?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    Any image can be edited prior to uploading the image. To edit the image, click on the “Edit image” icon <img
        src='/images/help/upload2.png'/>. The editing tool enables you to do simple editing such as Rotate, Crop,
    Resize, etc. For advanced editing we suggest using “Google Picnic Editor” which is integrated with
    myStoredLife.<br/>
    <img src='/images/help/upload1.png'/>

</div>

<div class='question'>If I upload an image now when will it be displayed?</div>

<hr/>
<h2 id="photo-workArea">Work Area</h2>

<div class='question'>What is Work Area?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    Work Area is a dress up location where you can enrich the image with further details such as “Caption, Who and Date”
    to remember and search easily in the future. The moment your image is uploaded, images will show up in “WORK AREA”
    section
</div>
<div class='question'>
    What are these 5 icons below the images (
    <img src="/images/delete.png"/>
    <img src="/images/unfav.png"/>
    <img src="/images/public.png"/>
    <img src="/images/nometadata.png"/>
    <img src="/images/unselect.png"/>
    ) ?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
    <img src="/images/delete.png"/> This allows you to delete the image from the Work Area. Deleted images can’t be
    retrieved back. You have to upload it again from the “Upload” section.<br/>
    <img src="/images/unfav.png"/> This allows you to add an image to your “Favorites”. When you click on the icon it
    changes to <img src="/images/fav.png"/> and those images will be automatically pushed to “Favorites” for slide show
    viewing.<br/>
    <img src="/images/public.png"/> This allows you to make any image “Private”. Private images can only be viewed by
    logging on to your myStoredLife account using your Goggle User ID and Password. As soon as you make any image
    “Private” the color of the icon changes to red <img src="/images/private.png"/> <br/>
    <img src='/images/nometadata.png'/> This allows you to add attributes or tags to one or multiple images at a time.
    The attributes or tags include “Caption”, “Who” and “Date”. Attributes and Tags make it easier to recall images when
    you are searching. As soon as an image is saved with attributes and/or tags the color of the icon changes to blue
    <br/>
    <img src="/images/unselect.png"/> The Select box is used to select one or multiple images to add attributes/tags or
    store images. <br/>


</div>
<div class='question'>What does “Add Photo Info” button do?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    This enables you add attributes and/or tags such as “Caption”, “Who” and “Date” to the image. You can add these
    attributes and/or tags to one or multiple images at a time. The Add Photo Info. improves your ability to perform
    more specific searches of your stored images.
</div>
<div class='question'>What does “Store Photo” button do?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    This enables you to store images using the myStoredLife photo organizational structure. You store photos in a
    person’s Profile and with Events and Sub Events to make it easier to search and share photos in the future. When you
    click on “Store Photo” you first select one or more people’s Profiles, then the Event that best represents the photo
    and finally you can create and name Sub Events to help organize your photos. You can store photos to any level you
    want. As an example, you can store a photo at the Profile level only, or select an Event under the Profile and
    finally you can create and name a Sub Event as the final level of storage. The more levels you use to store your
    photos the more organized they will be and the more specific you can search them in the future. Don’t forget you can
    also use “Add Photo Info.” to add Captions, Who and Dates to your photos for even better organization and
    search-ability.

        </li>
        <li>Search By Who - Enables you to search for any image by the name of the person tagged in the image. For ex:

            the “Who” criteria in Search and all images tagged with Jenny Smith will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>Search By When - Enables user to search for any image by exact date or variations of dates stored with an
            image in Work Area. For ex: If you have stored an image in the Work Area with the date 10/22/2002, then when
            you search by specific date “10/22/2002” all the images stored under this date will be displayed. Note: Date
            set on the actual image in the Work Area will show up, not the date image was uploaded. myStoredLife

            “The Previous Month”, “Specific Date”, “All Dates Before”, “All Dates After” and “Date Range”.
        </li>
        <li>Search By Profiles - Enables you to search images by Profile name. If you only search by the Profile name
            the last 50 images stored under that profile will be displayed. Click on the link at the bottom of the
            displayed images to load the next 50 photos.
        </li>
        <li>Search By Events - Enables you to search for an image by the Event it was stored under. For ex: if you saved
            an image under the “Birthday” Event with a Sub Event called “2nd”, you can create a search by selecting
            Event “Birthday” then Sub Event “2nd” and all the images stored under Event “Birthday” Sub Event “2nd” will
            be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class='question'>What is the expected behavior when you search only on top level Event?</div>
<div class='answer'>
    The expected behavior is this: When you search for images based on the "Event" only, the search result will be all
    the images stored under the “Event” and all associated “Sub Event” categories. When you search for images where the
    “Event” and “Sub Event” is selected only the images in that “Sub Event” will be displayed.
